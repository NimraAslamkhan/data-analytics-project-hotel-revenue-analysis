###Problem statement: 

The city hotel is experiencing significant challenges in managing its booking cancellations, optimizing revenue generation, and enhancing customer satisfaction and loyalty. Understanding the impact of lead time, seasonal patterns, and customer segmentation on cancellation rates, revenue fluctuations, and guest preferences is crucial for devising effective strategies to address these challenges.
###Challenge 1:

Lead Time Impact on Cancellation Rates and Revenue: The hotel needs to understand how the lead time, defined as the number of days between booking and arrival, influences cancellation rates and revenue. By analyzing this relationship, the hotel can develop strategies to manage capacity effectively and optimize pricing strategies to minimize revenue loss due to cancellations.
###Challenge 2:

Seasonality and Demand Fluctuations: Analyzing seasonal patterns and demand fluctuations is essential for the hotel to anticipate peak periods and adjust pricing and promotional strategies accordingly. By identifying seasonal trends and demand patterns, the hotel can optimize revenue generation and resource allocation during both peak and off-peak periods.
###Challenge 3: 

Customer Segmentation and Personalization: Understanding different customer segments and their preferences is vital for tailoring marketing strategies and services to enhance customer satisfaction and loyalty. By segmenting customers based on demographic factors, booking behavior, and preferences, the hotel can develop personalized marketing campaigns and customized experiences to meet the diverse needs of its guests.
###Assumptions:

1.	The dataset provides accurate and comprehensive information on hotel bookings, cancellations, customer demographics, and preferences.
2.	The lead time provided in the dataset accurately reflects the number of days between booking and arrival.
3.	Seasonal patterns and demand fluctuations observed in the dataset are representative of historical trends and can be used to predict future booking behavior.
4.	Customer segmentation based on available demographic and booking behavior data accurately represents distinct customer groups with varying preferences and behaviors.
5.	The hotel's capacity remains relatively stable during the analysis period, with no significant changes in room availability or inventory.

###Suggestion:


•	The cancellation rate of 63% indicates a significant portion of reservations are canceled. To mitigate this, consider implementing more flexible cancellation policies or targeted marketing campaigns to encourage guests to keep their reservations.
•	City hotels have a higher cancellation rate compared to resorts. Investigate the reasons behind this disparity and tailor cancellation policies or incentives to address them accordingly.
•	As resorts have more bookings on weekends, capitalize on this trend by offering special weekend packages or promotions to attract more guests and increase revenue
•	Analyze the seasonal trends in cancellation counts to anticipate peak periods and adjust staffing levels or marketing strategies accordingly
•	Monitor ADR trends to identify seasonal fluctuations and adjust pricing strategies accordingly to optimize revenue generation.
•	Identify trends in booking patterns to anticipate demand fluctuations and optimize resource allocation.
•	Explore strategies to minimize cancellations associated with longer lead times, such as offering incentives for early bookings or implementing flexible cancellation policies.
•	Adjust pricing and promotional strategies to capitalize on peak demand periods and optimize revenue generation.
•	Investigate factors influencing adult booking trends and tailor marketing strategies or amenities to attract this demographic and increase revenue.
